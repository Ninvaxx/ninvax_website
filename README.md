# Ninvax Website

This repository contains the source for Christopher Moore's personal website, **ninvax**.

## Pages
- `index.html` – home page with expandable sections for hobbies and social links.
- `photography.html` – placeholder for photography work.

The site is intentionally minimal and uses vanilla HTML/CSS with a few interactive `<details>` elements to reveal different trees of information.
