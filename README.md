# Ninvax Website

This repository contains the source for Christopher Moore's personal website, **ninvax**.

## Pages
- `index.html` – home page with expandable sections for hobbies and social links.
- `photography.html` – placeholder for photography work.

The site is intentionally minimal, using vanilla HTML and CSS. The latest design introduces a vibrant gradient background, Inter fonts and subtle entrance animations for a more modern, glassy feel.
